    "### Optimization for Bike Rebalancing (15 points)\n",
    "Bike rebalancing refers to the process of redistributing bicycles across the bike-sharing\n",
    "system to ensure an even availability of bikes and docking stations throughout a city. This is\n",
    "crucial for maintaining user convenience and satisfaction, as it addresses imbalances\n",
    "caused by high demand in certain areas and low usage in others.\n",
    "The rebalancing process typically involves monitoring bike usage data in real-time,\n",
    "identifying stations with high demand that are running low on bikes, and those with excess\n",
    "bikes that need to be moved. Operators may use trucks or electric vehicles to transport\n",
    "bikes from oversupplied stations to those in need, optimizing the system's overall\n",
    "efficiency.\n",
    "Question: Pick 20 stations of Citibike, a delivery person needs to start from Station A (any\n",
    "station you pick) and visit all other stations exactly once before returning to Station A. What\n",
    "is the shortest possible route the delivery person can take to complete this journey,\n",
    "minimizing the total distance traveled? Use Python to solve this Traveling Salesman\n",
    "Problem (TSP). Note: The distance between the stations can be calculated based on the\n",
    "longitude and latitude given."
